<p>I used to live a good life in Gabes with my family. As the years passed, the number of family members leaving the house increased. The departure of my two brothers for studies and work didn't have a significant impact since we weren't close due to the age gap. However, when my sister, with whom I used to share a bedroom, left, my life took a turn for the worse. We had a strong bond, and her absence was deeply felt.

    Then, the COVID-19 pandemic struck, further complicating matters. Despite the challenges, I still appreciated the way I used to live. I had a healthy routine, starting with an early morning shower, followed by a peaceful jog through empty streets while the birds sang and the air was filled with a refreshing breeze. Breakfast was a delightful affair, with the table adorned with delicious treats.
    
    After school, I would rest and indulge in reading, savoring the unique pleasure of old books. The aroma of food wafting from the oven added to the experience. Lunch, cooked lovingly by my grandma, was always a highlight. Unfortunately, she fell ill during the pandemic, and her condition changed, leaving a void in our lives.
    
    Post-COVID, I moved to Tunis to pursue my undergraduate studies, now living with my two brothers. Life with them has become a nightmare. We reside in cramped quarters and their behavior can be harsh and unkind at times. Gone are the days of a healthy lifestyle, with no more breakfast or lunch. Responsibilities weigh heavily on my shoulders, including cleaning, cooking, and managing my studies.
    
    Navigating university life is challenging, surrounded by arrogant individuals. I often have to wait for hours after class ends for my brothers to finish work and pick me up since I don't have my own means of transportation. Exhausted and unwell, I settle for whatever food is available before heading to sleep. These circumstances have left me mentally drained and resentful of the choice I made to study in Tunis.
    
    Weekends are particularly tough, as meeting up with dear friends becomes an arduous task in this vast city. Limited financial means prevent me from taking taxis, and my brothers aren't always available to provide transportation. I spend most of my weekends indoors, sleeping, as I lack the motivation to engage in activities. Over the past four years, I've gained valuable wisdom, although it remains hidden until prompted by relevant discussions.
    
    In Gabes, I used to find solace in cycling, often visiting the breathtaking Golf Beach, even during the winter months. But now, everything has changed. I've resorted to smoking, abandoning my once-healthy lifestyle. With every cigarette I smoke, I knowingly choose to shorten my life rather than endure the challenges I currently face. I am filled with sadness, surviving each day, and desperately hoping for a better future. In this quest, I've reached out to my mother, seeking her presence in the hope that it may bring some much-needed improvement to my current circumstances.</p>
